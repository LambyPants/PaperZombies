<h1>PaperZombies</h1>

A zombie survival game made with Paper.js -- use your keyboard and mouse to shoot zombies and earn a higher score. If you collect 3 gas tanks, you'll
have enough fuel to power your zombie crushing sports car. But be careful! Zombies get more numerous and faster the more you kill. How long will you survive the zombie apocalypse?

As an experiment, this project relied only on Paper.js to draw its sprites and characters; no outside SVG images were used in the making of this game.
